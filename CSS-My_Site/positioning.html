<!-- Some rules to follow for CSS positioning:-
1. Content is everything.
2. Order comes from Code for CSS display and design.
3. Children sit on parents i.e. actions for children comes first in the webpage. 

Position:- 
1. Static: Default, no special property needed. Elements flow as they are written in HTML code.
Not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties.
2. Relative: When an element is positioned relatively, you can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to move it relative to its normal position.
3. Absolute : Removes element from normal document flow & positions it relative to its cloest positioned ancestor or its parent or initial containing block.
4. Fixed : Same as absolute, but element is positioned relative to viewport and stays in same position even when page is scrolled.
5. Sticky: Hybrid b/w relative and fixed, element is initially in normal flow but becomes fixed once it reaches specified scroll position. -->
